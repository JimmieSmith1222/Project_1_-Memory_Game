# Project_1_-Memory_Game
The name of this game is: Memento Memory!
Memory games have been around for a long time and if you are not familiar with them then your about to be with the simple click of this link here in this readme so buckle in and have fun!
Some background of the game before you start would be that basically its a match the cards game. There are 9 different pictures in this one so far and depending on how popular it is I will develop more!

The following were used in the creation of this game: HTML, CSS, Javascript, and a simple JSON file.
The game is pretty straightforward and small at this moment but I will enhance it soon. The link to try it is below.

My future plans for this game include but are not limited to: adding levels with more cards, adding ways to gain lives, adding powerups (such as getting an instant free match), etc.
